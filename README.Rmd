Installation
--------------
```r
# install.packages("devtools",repos="https://cloud.r-project.org")
devtools::install_github("zhenkewu/baker")
```
Note: 

* run `install.packages("pbkrtest")` for `R(>=3.2.3)` if this
package is reported as missing.
* Windows User: use `devtools::install_github("zhenkewu/baker",INSTALL_opts=c("--no-multiarch"))` instead if you see an error message `ERROR: loading failed for 'i386'` (Thanks Chrissy!).

<div id='id-section2'/>

Vignettes
-------------
```r
devtools::install_github("zhenkewu/baker", build_vignettes=TRUE) # will take extra time to run a few examples.
browseVignettes("baker")
```
<div id='id-section3'/>

Graphical User Interface (GUI)
--------------------------------
```r
# install.packages("devtools",repos="http://watson.nci.nih.gov/cran_mirror/")
devtools::install_github("zhenkewu/baker")
shiny::runApp(system.file("shiny", package = "baker"))
```

For developers interested in low-level details, here is a pretty awesome [visualization](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44143110/visualizing-r-function-dependencies)
of the function dependencies within the package:

```r
library(DependenciesGraphs) # if not installed, try this-- devtools::install_github("datastorm-open/DependenciesGraphs")
library(QualtricsTools) # devtools::install_github("emmamorgan-tufts/QualtricsTools")
dep <- funDependencies('package:baker','nplcm')
plot(dep)
```
You will get a dynamic figure. A snapshot is below:

<div id='id-section4'/>

Analytic Goal
-------------------------------------

- To study disease etiology from case-control data from multiple sources that have measurement errors. If you are interested in estimating the population etiology pie (fraction), and the probability of each cause for individual case, try `baker`.

<div id='id-section5'/>

Comparison to Other Existing Solutions
------------------------------------------------
- Acknowledges various levels of measurement errors and combines multiple sources
of data for optimal disease diagnosis.
- Main function: `nplcm()` that fits the model with or without covariates.

<div id='id-section6'/>

Details
-------------------------------------

1. Implements hierarchical Bayesian models to infer disease etiology for multivariate binary data. The package builds in functionalities for data cleaning, exploratory data analyses, model specification, model estimation, visualization and model diagnostics and comparisons, catalyzing vital effective communications between analysts and practicing clinicians. 
2. `baker` has implemented models for dependent measurements given disease status, regression analyses of etiology, multiple imperfect measurements, different priors for true positive rates among cases with differential measurement characteristics, and multiple-pathogen etiology.
3. Scientists in [Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/ivac/projects/perch/) (PERCH) study usually refer to the etiology distribution as "*population etiology pie*" and "*individual etiology pie*" for their compositional nature, hence the name of the package.

<div id='id-section7'/>

Platform
---------
- The `baker` package is compatible with OSX, Linux and Windows systems, each requiring a slightly different setup as described below. If you need to speed up the installation and analysis, please contact the 
maintainer or chat by clicking the `gitter` button at the top of this README file.

Connect `R` to `JAGS`/`WinBUGS`
---------------------------------
#### Mac OSX 10.11 El Capitan

1. Use [Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS)](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)
2. Install JAGS 4.2.0; Download [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/4.x/Mac%20OS%20X/)
3. Install `R`; Download from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)
4. Fire up `R`, run `R` command `install.packages("rjags")`
5. Run `R` command `library(rjags)` in R console; If the installations are successful, you'll see some notes like this:

```r
>library(rjags)
Loading required package: coda
Linked to JAGS 4.x.0
Loaded modules: basemod,bugs
```

- Run `R` command `library(baker)`. If the package `ks` cannot be loaded due to failure of loading package `rgl`, first install X11 by going [here](https://www.xquartz.org/releases/XQuartz-2.7.11.html), followed by
```r
install.packages("http://download.r-forge.r-project.org/src/contrib/rgl_0.95.1504.tar.gz",repo=NULL,type="source")
```

#### Unix (Build from source without administrative privilege)

Here we use [JHPCE](https://jhpce.jhu.edu/) as an example. [The complete installation guide](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/Manuals/4.x/) offers 
extra information. 

1. Download source code for [JAGS 4.2.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/4.x/Source/JAGS-4.2.0.tar.gz/download);

2. Suppose you've downloaded it in `~/local/jags/4.2.0`. Follow the bash commands below:

    ``` bash
    # change to the directory with the newly downloaded source files:
    cd ~/local/jags/4.2.0
    
    # create a new folder named "usr"
    mkdir usr
    
    # decompress files:
    tar zxvf JAGS-4.2.0.tar.gz
    
    # change to the directory with newly decompressed files:
    cd ~/local/jags/4.2.0/JAGS-4.2.0
    
    
    
    # specify new JAGS home:
    export JAGS_HOME=$HOME/local/jags/4.2.0/usr
    export PATH=$JAGS_HOME/bin:$PATH
    
    # link to BLAS and LAPACK:
    # Here I have used "/usr/lib64/atlas/" and "/usr/lib64/" on JHPCE that give me
    # access to libblas.so.3 and liblapack.so.3. Please modify to paths on your system.
    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib64/atlas/ -L/usr/lib64/" ./configure --prefix=$JAGS_HOME --libdir=$JAGS_HOME/lib64 
    
    # if you have 8 cores:
    make -j8
    make install
    
    # prepare to install R package, rjags:
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/local/jags/4.2.0/usr/lib64/pkgconfig 
    
    module load R
    R> install.packages("rjags")
    # or if the above fails, try:
    R>install.packages("rjags", configure.args="--enable-rpath")
    ```

3. Also check out the [INSTALLATION](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rjags/INSTALL) file for `rjags` package.

Submitting Jobs to Computing Cluster via a shell script
---------------------------------
Again, I use JHPCE as an example.
``` bash
#!/bin/bash
#$ -M zhenkewu@gmail.com
#$ -N baker_regression_perch
#$ -o /users/zhwu/baker_regression/data_analysis/baker_regression_test.txt
#$ -e /users/zhwu/baker_regression/data_analysis/baker_regression_test.txt

export JAGS_HOME=$HOME/local/jags/4.2.0/usr
export PATH=$JAGS_HOME/bin:$PATH

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$JAGS_HOME/lib64

cd /users/zhwu/baker_regression/data_analysis
#$ -cwd

echo "**** Job starts ****"
date
echo "**** JHPCE info ****"
echo "User: ${USER}"
echo "Job id: ${JOB_ID}"
echo "Job name: ${JOB_NAME}"
echo "Hostname: ${HOSTNAME}" 

Rscript real_regression_data_jhpce.R

echo "**** Job ends ****" 
date
```

<div id='id-section10'/>
#### Windows 

- JAGS 4.2.0
1. Install `R`; Download from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. Install [JAGS 4.2.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/4.x/Windows/); Add the path to JAGS 4.2.0 into the environmental variable (essential for R to find the jags program). See [this](http://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10) for setting environmental variables;
- alternatives are `brew install -v jags` for OSX, `sudo apt-get install jags` for Ubuntu/Debian
3. Fire up `R`, run `R` command `install.packages("rjags")`
4. Install [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (for building and installing R pacakges from source); Add the path to `Rtools` (e.g. `C:\Rtools\`) into your environmental variables so that R knows where to find it. 

<!-- - [WinBUGS 1.4.3](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/) -->
<!--     1. Install the [patch](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs-patches/) -->
<!--     2. Install the WinBUGS 1.4.x [immortality key](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/) -->
<div id='id-section11'/>
#### Datasets 

We provide two datasets for exploratory use with the `baker` package. 

1. `data_nplcm_reg`: a dataset containing BrS measurements, case-control status, and regression covariates (testing site and enrollment date). This dataset was generated using the `simulate_nplcm` function. We also provide the BrS measurements, case-control status, and regression covariates (testing site and enrollment date). Code to fit the NPLCM to this dataset is in the accompanying software paper and the full code used to produce this dataset is available upon request. Using this dataset and the functionality in `baker`, a user can reproduce Figures 7 and 8 in the accompanying software paper. 

2. `baker_posterior_samples_example`: a folder which contains the output of an NPLCM fitted to real data. We are not able to provide the real data due to privacy restrictions. Instead, we provide: 
   * a. the posterior samples, which can be found in `CODAchain1.txt` and `CODAindex.txt`.
   * b. the covariates used in fitting the model (`ENRLDATE` and `AGE`), which can be found in `data_nplcm.txt`. Note that this folder can be found here [to be added]()
   
Using the posterior samples in this folder, Figure 10 of the software paper can be replicated. If you would like to use `baker` visualization functions on this data, please download the compressed folder directly to your local drive, so that the path to the folder containing these `.txt` files can be provided as an argument for the plotting functions.
