# Hypothetical pathogens and their categories (virus or bacteria)

This is used in simulations where the pathogen names are from the
alphabet, and we hope to plot etiologies grouped by virus or bacteria

## Usage

``` r
data("pathogen_category_simulation")
```

## Format

A matrix of two columns

- pathogen:

  names of the hypothetical pathogens, A-Z

- pathogen_type:

  category of the hypothetical pathogens, `B` for bacterium, `V` for
  virus, which are randomly assigned.

## Value

No returned value; just loading data into the working space.
